<h2 id="setting-the-windows-cursor">Setting the Windows Cursor</h2>
<p>erg.. It feels like it's going to take longer to describe the problems
with the system than to just fix it. But let it be said that there IS
a problem keeping the Windows cursor up to date. Right now it's always
behind by at least one mouse-move message. We need a more sophisticated
synchronization system than "add message to queue and forget".</p>

<p>Also, I REALLY need to draw a thread diagram out and have it unified
across the different platforms. Or at least as little difference as
possible.</p>
