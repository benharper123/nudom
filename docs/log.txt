	You must specify either the width or the height of an element. If the element contains only text, then its height
	is known. But... what if that element spans multiple lines, then its height is not known.

	We DO need to do something like recursive layout, but we can probably do it with a single pass.
	The key concept to add is "minimum width". Text is a strange thing, because it has no size up
	front, and it can take on many forms. So in order to lay out a text box, you need to give it
	a maximum width. Text in turn, has a minimum width, which I guess is the width of an "m".
