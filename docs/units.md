Measurement Units
=================

* __Pixels__ These are real device pixels (ignoring the sub-pixel layout of the screen). This is whatever the hardware tells us it has.
* __Angular Pixel__ (TODO) This is an imaginary unit that is calibrated to the DPI of the screen as well as the typical viewing distance
from the screen. It is supposed to represent a constant angle subtended by an image on the screen of unit size.
