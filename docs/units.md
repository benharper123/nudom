Measurement Units
=================

* __Pixels__ These are real device pixels (ignoring the sub-pixel layout of the screen, such as PenTile, Diamond, RGB etc). This is whatever the hardware tells us it has.
* __Eye Pixel__  This is an imaginary unit that is calibrated to the DPI of the screen as well as the typical viewing distance from the screen. It is supposed to represent a constant number of retina receptors in a human eye.
* __Percent__ Percentage of parent node's content box.
* __Zero__ Unitless zero.
* __Points__ Not sure if this is a good idea... not implemented.
