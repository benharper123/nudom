This was last tested with the NDK version r9

Simply make your current directory samples/Android (the same directory that contains this BUILD-HOWTO file),
and run 'ndk-build'.

You can bring build times down by using 'ndk-build -j8' (or however many logical cores you have).

That ought to give you libs/<platform>/libnudom.so

You should now be able to load the project in eclipse, and deploy to a device.
