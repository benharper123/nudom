For the C++ side of things, you need the Crystax NDK r7 (http://www.crystax.net/en/android/ndk/7)
This is necessary for some C++11 features (auto and decltype). It might be prudent to get rid of that
dependency.

I have only tried this on Ubuntu 12.04.

Simply make your current directory samples/Android (the same directory that contains this BUILD-HOWTO file),
and run 'ndk-build'.

ndk-build must be in your path, and must point to the root of the crystax NDK.

That ought to give you libs/<platform>/libnudom.so

You should now be able to load the project in eclipse, and deploy to a device.
